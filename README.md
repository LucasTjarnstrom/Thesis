# Thesis
This repo contains the code used for creating and evaluating the results in the master's thesis "Retrospective Evaluation of Methods for Term Structure Measurement".

# AMPL

To run the optimization model Blomvall-Ndengo you will need AMPL. The demo version is restricted to 300 variables and the example file is implemented with a limited data set to accommodate for this constraint. In order to run the code for this project in full, you will need a trial or a licensed version of AMPL that does not constrain the size of the optimization problem.
